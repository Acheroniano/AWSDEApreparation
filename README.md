...... 2. Transform and process data <br>
...... 3. Orchestrate data pipelines <br>
...... 4. Apply programming concepts <br>
........ Data ingestion, is about stream data, database migration and how do i get data into Redshift ? <br>
........ Focus in ECS, EKS, Fargate, Lambda and Glue ( Glue is one of the most important topics of the exam) <br>
........ Step functions, Pipelines process, SNS, SQS, some questions in exam may touch and ask about your SQL skills <br>
........ as a part of applying programming concepts, you may be asked about AWS CDK and Cloud formation. <br>
........ you need to know aspects of CSVs, file types relationed to data structures.<br>
////----<br>

........ in relational data service (RDS). <br>
........ After you ingest data and after you store the data, you have to catalog it. <br>
........ You have to look at GLUE DATA CATALOG, APACHE HIVE, METASTORES.<br>
........ How do you get the SCHEMA of the data with GLUE CRAWLER.<br>
........ You will use the S3 Life cycle policies, example: if you have data that´s 60 days old, how i should handle it ?<br>
........ How you ensure the ACCURACY of DATA ? How to track the lineage of data ingested, his transformations and life cycle ? <br>

...... 4. Ensure data quality <br>
........ At this point you ingested and stored data, now is the time to process, and extract insights from the data <br>
........ How do i automate data processing using AWS services ? <br>
........ Focus on STEP FUNCTIONS, AWS GLUE, AWS SAGE MAKER, this exam do not focus on Machine Learning but SAGE MAKER can process data <br>
........ You should be familiar with SAGE MAKER DATA WRANGLER and some components around it.<br>
........ You may see LAMBDA, EVENT BRIDGE and different ways to automate and process data.<br>
........ The exam is more focused in DATA than the analytics, but you have to look at ATHENA, QUICKSIGHT <br>
........ AWS GLUE and CLOUDWATCH come up in the Maintain and monitor data pipelines.<br>
........ To ensure data quality you have to use AWS GLUE, AWS GLUE DATA BREW, example: empty fields, missing data in a data set, etc. <br>
////----<br>
<h2>...... Domain 4 : Data Security and Governance ( 18% of the exam )</h2> <br>
...... 1. Apply authentication mechanisms <br>
...... 2. Apply authorization mechanisms <br>
...... 3. Ensure data encryption ans masking <br>
...... 4. Prepare logs for audity <br>
...... 5. Understand data privacy and governance <br>
........ At this point you knows about ingestion, storage, the operation aspect and how to process data.<br>
........ The Domain 4 is about security and governance aspect of the data environment.<br>
........ Aspects of VPC, IAM: example: How to process data in S3 tha it´s outside your VPC. <br>
........ How to access data in REDSHIFT, his tables, rows and columns.<br>
........ KMS Service to encrypt data. <br>
........ CLOUDWATCH and CLOUDTRAIL services to audity the data environment.<br>
........ Example of governance: PII identified by AWS MACIE and how to integrate it with LAKE FORMATION. <br>
........ At governance aspect of DATA Environment we will look at how to use AWS CONFIG <br>
........<br>
